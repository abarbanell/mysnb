title: Welcome to my Spark Notebooks
category: spark
tags: spark, scala, notebook

This is the project website for
[mysnb](https://github.com/abarbanell/mysnb), a collection of spark
notebooks for my own use. You may learn something out of it, or you
may not. I make no warranties.

At the same time this is a place for me to blog about spark and
related themes, as my main blog needs a bit cleanup and grouping
of different topics.

Here we go. 

# First things first

How do I use these notebooks? Well, it is easy, but there is a lot
of components to get together, so here is a quick rundown of my
setup as of Jun-2016:

- MacOS : I run all this on my Mac (El Capitan 10.11.5) with 8GB RAM. 
- Docker: I love docker for the ease of keeping different installations
separate and removing them when no longer needed. The [docker for
Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker#/mac) toolset has made
this really easy - get this first.
- fork the [abarbanell/mysnb](https://github.com/abarbanell/mysnb)
repo and clone to your desktop. (Hint: you may want to delete the
"gh-pages" branch because it contains these blog pages, not the
code)
- start the notebook server with 

```
$ start.sh
```

- point your browser to http://localhost:9000 or 

```
$ open http://localhost:9000
```

A more detailed explanation is in the
[README.md](https://github.com/abarbanell/mysnb/blob/master/README.md)
file.

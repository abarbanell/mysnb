I have used these notebooks on MacOS with the new Mac Docker engine (still beta). Highly experimental.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nTobias Abarbanell (@abarbanell) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nI have tried to add explanations in the notebooks and the readme of the master branch. Beyond that - may the source be with you.\r\n",
